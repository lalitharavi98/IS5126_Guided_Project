# IS5126_Guided_Project - Loan Default Prediction

Within the loan approval process, a borrower who fails to
fulfill their repayment obligations is considered a default. This
leads to financial losses for the bank. To proactively manage
this risk and enhance lending effectiveness, we propose de-
veloping a machine learning model. This model will leverage
historical loan data and be optimized through experimentation
with various machine-learning techniques. Its primary objec-
tive is to accurately predict the likelihood of loan defaults
for individual borrowers. By identifying high-risk profiles, the
model empowers banks to make informed lending decisions,
ultimately promoting financial stability.
